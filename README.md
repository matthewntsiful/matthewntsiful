## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Cloud & DevOps Engineer specializing in AWS infrastructure design, containerization, and CI/CD automation. My technical expertise includes architecting scalable multi-tier applications, implementing infrastructure as code with Terraform, and optimizing deployment pipelines. I build robust cloud-native solutions with a focus on security, scalability, and operational efficiency. Proficient in Linux system administration, container orchestration, and web server configuration, I leverage these core skills to develop and deploy applications using modern DevOps practices. My work centers on creating efficient infrastructure solutions that support business objectives through automation, monitoring, and continuous improvement.
